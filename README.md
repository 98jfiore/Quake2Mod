Class Project for IT266 <br />
## Earthbound Mod <br />
In order to open and play this mod, create a mod folder in the base of your version of Quake 2 (I copied the ctf folder and gave it a new name), open the earthbound branch from this repository, set the output file to be gamex86.dll and the output directory to be your new file, build Game, open the mod and start playing. <br />
  ### What it does: <br />
    All weapons use the same type of ammo (bullets)
    Combat is iniated when damage is done to a monster or you
    Ammo is only spent in combat.
    Combat is turn-based.
    Damage dealt to you in combat goes down over time instead of all at once.
    Every weapon is themed like an Earthbound attack.
    Defeating enemies gets you experience.
    After you get enough experience, you will level up and gain some bonuses.
  ### Deliverables it accomplishes: <br />
    All ammo is based on one resource
    The damage mechanics from Earthbound are approximated
    Combat is turn based
    Player can level up
    Weapons are themed to Earthbound
